The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him.</p><p>The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do, and made him sit down.</p><p>“I have been assured,” said the Cat, “that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.”</p><p>“That is true,” answered the ogre very briskly; “and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.”</p></div> </div>
