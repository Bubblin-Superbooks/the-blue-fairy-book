Set out early to-morrow morning, and when you have passed the iron gate throw the clew of thread before you, which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle.

The lions will be so busy eating they will let you pass by them.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Prince Ahmed set out the next morning at the time</p></div> </div>
