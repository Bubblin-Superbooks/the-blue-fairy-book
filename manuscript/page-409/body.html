     Round and round dance we;
   Thus do we dance from the days of old
     About the enchanted tree;
   Round, and round, and round we go,
   While the spring is green, or the stream shall flow,
     Or the wind shall stir the sea!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   There is none may taste of the golden fruit
     Till the golden new time come
   Many a tree shall spring from shoot,
   Many a blossom be withered at root,
     Many a song be dumb;
   Broken and still shall be many a lute
     Or ever the new times come!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Round and round the tree of gold,
     Round and round dance we,
   So doth the great world spin from of old,
