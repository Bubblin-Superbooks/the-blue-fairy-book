So the King set out to seek a fairy, and asked what he could do to win the Princess’s love. The Fairy said to him:</p><p>“You know that the Princess has a great cat which she is very fond of. Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat’s tail is the man she is destined to marry.”</p><p>The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult, and he left the Fairy, determined to grind the cat’s tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all.</p></div> </div>
