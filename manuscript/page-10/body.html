But, though the gardeners were many and the soil was good, this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits, not even grass or shady trees.</p><p>The King was in despair about it, when a wise old man said to him:</p><p>“Your gardeners do not understand their business: but what can you expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and carpenters? How should they have learned to cultivate your garden?”</p><p>“You are quite right,” cried the King.</p></div> </div>
