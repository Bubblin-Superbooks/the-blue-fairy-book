They went to all the waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to no purpose.</p><p>At last, however, the Queen had a daughter. There was a very fine christening; and the Princess had for her god-mothers all the fairies they could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one of them might give her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those days. By this means the Princess had all the perfections imaginable.</p></div> </div>
